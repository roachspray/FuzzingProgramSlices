This is a bit hokey, currently. It just looks for functions containing 
cksum or checksum in their name...so, right. There are other means of
doing this that should be implemented, including that of some work I 
cannot remember (I think released December 2017) where they perform some
actual analysis of instructions to then say ``ok, this is checksum-like''.
