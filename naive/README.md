The naive code is the first whack at doing something in this
realm. The code can be found in the
(acsac17wip repo)[https://github.com/roachspray/acsac17wip]. 
I am not going to duplicate it here, but rather just point to
it (not even as a submodule). The results there were really 
unclear as to how well or not well it did. Suffice to say that
likely it does not perform well. I think it needs some more
testing and results analysis to say for sure.
